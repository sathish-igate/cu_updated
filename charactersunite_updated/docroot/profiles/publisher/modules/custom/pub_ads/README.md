Pub Ads 
=================================

The Pub Ads Module is specific to Publisher at NBC.

Purposes
---------------

The Pub Ads Module has two purposes: 

1.  When installing publisher, Pub Ads creates default configuration settings for you as defined by Ad Ops, determining whether you have DART or DFP installed, and adjusting accordingly. 
2.  Pub Ads creates Video Companion ads tab for Global Settings.  You need to provide IDs for the ads.  There are 5 of them.  This applies to NBC only.  
Video Companion Ads (NBC only)

To enter Video Companion Ad settings:  

1.  On the left pane, click **Video Companion Ads**.  

2.  Enter the video companion ad **ID** provided by NBCU's AdOps. Leave the field blank if you do not need another video companion ad.

###Pixelman 
Pixelman places JavaScript code on every NBC site so that services like Nielsen or Comscore can analyze how the sites are being used.  

As of Publisher release v7.245.1, there is a separate module for Pixelman.  

If there are no ads, sites can still use Pixelman.  

_**Note: Pixelman recognizes when you are using DFP or DART and adjusts accordingly.**_
